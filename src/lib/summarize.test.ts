A large language model (LLM) is a language model characterized by its large size.
Its size is enabled by AI accelerators, which are able to process vast amounts of 
text data, mostly scraped from the Internet. LLMs are artificial neural networks 
which can contain a billion to trillions of weights, and are (pre-)trained using 
self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Transformer architecture contributed 
to faster training. Alternative architectures include the mixture of experts (MoE), 
which has been proposed by Google, starting with sparsely-gated ones in 2017, Gshard 
in 2021 to GLaM in 2022.

As language models, they work by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the 
next token or word. Up to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be 
adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, 
however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. They are thought to 
acquire embodied knowledge about syntax, semantics and "ontology" inherent in human 
language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.
    
Notable examples include OpenAI's GPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT),
Google's PaLM (used in Bard), and Meta's LLaMa, as well as BLOOM, Ernie 3.0 Titan, 
and Claude.`;
